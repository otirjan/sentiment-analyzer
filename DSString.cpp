/* 
 * Implement the functions defined in DSString.h. You may add more functions as needed
 * for the project. 
 *
 * Note that c-strings don's store an explicit length but use `\0` as the terminator symbol
 * but your class should store its length in a member variable. 
 * DDO NOT USE C-STRING FUNCTIONS <string.h> or <cstring>.
